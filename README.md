My Portfolio Website
Welcome to my very first portfolio website!
This project marks my introduction to web development, design, and building something fully from scratch. I wanted my first project to feel fun, nostalgic, and personal so I built a Windows 98–themed interactive desktop, complete with folders, icons, and even a space‑shooter game running in the background.

This site is still a work in progress, and I’ll continue updating it as I learn more and expand my skills.

Project Overview
This portfolio is designed to look and feel like a classic Windows 98 desktop environment. Instead of a traditional scrolling website, you can explore my work by opening folders, clicking icons, and navigating through a retro interface.

The site includes:

A Start Menu and taskbar

Clickable folders for About Me, Projects, Skills, and Contact

Retro .txt file windows for information

Authentic Win98 icons and UI elements

A space‑shooter game running behind the desktop for extra fun

Background Game: Space Shooter
Behind the desktop interface, you’ll find a simple space‑shooter game inspired by classic arcade mechanics.

Controls:

← → Move

SPACE Shoot

ENTER Restart after game over

Your ship briefly blinks after taking damage to show invincibility frames.
